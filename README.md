 Hi, I’m @ArchFunke
 I’m interested in starting my professional career as a software engineer and learning as much as a can on the way.
 I’m currently working on learning C# and ASP.NET by making some basic web apps and hopefully expanding them into something useful.
 I never used GitHub much as a student, so I am trying to get into the habit of utilizing it more!
